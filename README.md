#cs-website-ip-address

`cs-website-ip-address` is a windows tool that you can use to determine the *ip address*
of the server hosting a website. Generally, one would do this by using `ping` in command
prompt with the website name. So why this? Because i am so lazy to type in the name of
website in command prompt with the `ping` command, and get the website details. Here, you
just copy the whole *URL* and put it in, get the ip address, copy that too, and use it
where you needed.
