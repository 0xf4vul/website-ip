#cs-website-ip-address

`cs-website-ip-address` is a windows tool that you can use to determine the *ip address*
of the server hosting a website. Generally, one would do this by using `ping` in command
prompt with the website name. So why this?

Because i am so lazy to:
- open command prompt
- type in the name of website with the `ping` command
- write back the ip address where its needed

Here:
- Just copy the whole *URL* and put it in
- Get the ip address, copy that too
- Use it where you needed
